### UXBank

# This project simulates the basic operations of an ATM, Withdrawal and Deposit.

Every user gets access to 3 account types, namely
BankAcct, ATM_BankAcct and ATM_GoldAcct.

For ATM_BankAcct,
Withdrawal fee = $2.50
Deposit fee = $1.00

For ATM_GoldAcct,
For account balance of $20000 or more, ATM fees are not charged
and for account balance of $5000 a percentage is added as interest.

Banking transactions are simultaneously carried out on all three accounts.
